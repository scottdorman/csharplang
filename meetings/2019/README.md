# Upcoming meetings for 2019

## Schedule ASAP

### Async Iterators

- Confirm change of behavior for cancellation tokens

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2434

### Nullable Reference Types

- Default constraint for type parameters declared in a `#nullable disable`d context.

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2398
  (Will possibly be resolved by offline)

- Inheriting constraints declared in a disabled context with an override in an enabled context.

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/29979

- Type parameters declared in a `#nullable disable`d context but referenced in a `#nullable enabled`d context.

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2409

### Coalescing Assignment

- `??=` with `Nullable<T>` LHS and `T` (underlying VT) RHS (Fred)

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/34#issuecomment-444699550 and discussion following

### Index/Range Feature

- Pattern-based index/range translation (Jared, Stephen)

  (Will possibly be resolved by offline)

### Nullable Reference Types

- When we compute an annotation in the walker (e.g. type inference), do we use the context?

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/33639

- Inferred nullable state from a finally block

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/34018

### Pattern-Matching

- Can we make the switch expression target-typed?

  See also https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2389

## Schedule when convenient

- Nullable Reference Types: Open LDM Issues https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2201
- Default Implementation Members: Open LDM Issues https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/406
- Allowing pattern-based `foreach` and `await foreach` to bind to an extension `GetEnumerator`/`GetAsyncEnumerator` and `MoveNext`/`MoveNextAsync` (Julien/Chris)
- Syntax of positional records/primary constructors (Andy)
- Discussion of refreshing language spec (Neal)
